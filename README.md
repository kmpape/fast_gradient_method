# fast_gradient_method
An implementation of the fast gradient method. For the algorithm, see "Introductory Lectures on Convex Optimization, Y. Nesterov". This implementation uses the "constant step scheme II". A projection function and the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of the objective function matrix must be provided. See also https://github.com/kmpape/box_rate_projection.git.
